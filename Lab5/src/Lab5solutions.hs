{-
 - Benchmark Exm implementation for random data
 - We use the `defaultMainWith` method from Criterion to run our benchmarks.
 - This method expects a list of benchmarks, each encapsulated by an environment (the `env` function)
 - This environment makes sure the same randomly generated test data is given to all functions in the benchmark.
 - If the environment was not used, two functions in the same benchamrk could recieve different testdata,
 - and the comparison would no longer be fair. This method was sourced from:
 - https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/obverse-versus-reverse-benchmarking-in-haskell-with-criterion
 - One pitfall is the requirement that benchmark funcitons use lazy pattern matching. This is achieved by
 - adding a tilde `~` character before the pattern. also the use of the `whnf` function is required in order to
 - make the resulting structure lazy. Critirion requires this in order to evaluate the function only while being timed.
 -
 - So we wanted to test higher numbers, but the expM
    function would crash our laptops with a size of 10^10.
 - For low numbers in a range of (1,100) we noticed that the
    expM is an order of magnitude faster. We theorise that this has
    to do with the overhead of recursion on smaller numbers.
 - For numbers between (1, 10^5) we noticed that our exM function
    was about 3 times faster than than the expM function.
 - For numbers between (1, 10^8) we saw a huge speedup in our exM function
    compared to the expM function.
    The results varied from microseconds for our exM function versus
        miliseconds of our expM function.
 - To conclude we see that our function is slower for small values around the 100s.
 - We see a slight speedup in the larger numbers around 10^5.
 - We see several orders of magnitude speedup for values around 10^8
 - We would like to test higher values as well, but as we mentioned before
    this would take a long time and computers with good performance to test the expM function.
 - It would also be interesting to test the (memory) efficiency and do complexity estimation
    increasing the number of bits.
 - Another thing to mention is that our function is limited by the recursion limit.

 - Exercise 2
 - Time: 120 min
 - A way of testing infinite lists is mentioned in the QuickCheck paper:
https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quick.pdf
 - It says that two infinite lists are equal if all finite initial segments are equal.
 - This is not always the case, you can program in logic which makes the list stop working after a certain number
 - For example in a list comprehension, use an extra conditional to say that the number should be lower than some arbitrary number.
 - If that happens this way of testing doesn't work.
 - We can however, find some errors in the function looking at a initial finite part.

{-
 - Exercise 3
 - In addition to the single trials, do some testing on the modes of the smallest composite numbers accepted for any k.
 - We hypothesize that the least composite number scales exponentially with k due to needing to pass all tests.
 - Early testing results seem to agree with this.
 -
 - Note that the test may take a long time due to nondeterminism.
 - The running time of the test should scale somewhat exponentially too.
 - This is due to the combination of more or larger: k's used, repeated trials,
 -  higher primes (in the composite generator), higher exponentiation.
 - Each aspect causes the others to increase as well.
 - Fairly conservative values were chosen, but it may still be necessary to restart the test in some cases.

 - Exercise 4
 - Fermat's little theorem states a^(p-1) mod p = 1 for any prime p and integer a not divisible by p.
 - Carmichael numbers are numbers for which this is true for any a coprime to them.
 - Thus a carmichael number will fool the Fermat primality test if only coprime a's are picked.
 - The generated list is a subset of the carmichael numbers.
 -
 - We expect the carmichael numbers to fool the Fermat primality test most of the time.
 - The proportion of this depends on the number of coprimes and amount of a's picked k.
 - The formula for this is ((ncoprimes n) / (n - 2))^k.
 - The base pass rate (k=1) of the first carmichael number 294409 is ~0.95%.
 - Thus we expect ~(0.95^k)% of least composites to be the first carmichael number.

 - Proof from workshop answers:
 - Euclids gcd algorithm has a base case of (1,1) for a coprime pair input.
 - The given tree generation function `step` does the reverse of euclid's GCD algorithm.
 - So if  supply a starting value of (1,1), we would end up generating all coprime pairs.
 - The explanation was already given in the answers to workhop 5.

 - Changing [(x+y,x),(x,x+y)] to [(x+y,y),(x,x+y)] changes only the symmetry from subtree-symmetric
 - to y-axis symmetric. Changing symmetry does not alter content, so tree1 and tree2 contain the same values
 - and are therefore both proven by the euclidan GCD proof.
 - That both trees contain the same values can be seen clearly in the following comparison:

 - In this exercise we present our RSA implementation.
 - Instead of the given functions we implement our own encryption and decryption keys because we weren't
    satisfied with (partial lack of) random element they presented.
 - We test three properties:
    - Whether encrypting and decrypting in succession results in the original message.
    - Whether encryption doesn't just return the original message
    - Whether decryption doesn't just return the ciphertext.
 - We test these properties for a single key (so with multiple messages) using rsaTest
 - rsaTestMult tests the aforementioned function a number of times (see Main.hs).
 - The key length we use is 1024, since that keeps the algorithm runnable in reasonable time for multiple runs.
 - Another thing is that according to the wikipedia article above, RSA can be vulnerable to known plaintext attacks 
    if no padding is used. 
 - Our implementation does not feature padding. This would be future work.
 - Another thing that needs to be investigated is the security of this particular implementation of RSA.
